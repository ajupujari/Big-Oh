Big-Oh
======
A geeky clone of 2048 for programmers .
##Achieve Big-Oh of 1 .

Order of merging :
`O(2`<sup>`n`</sup>`)`
`O(n!)`
`O(n`<sup>`2`</sup>`)`
`O(nlogn)`
`O(nlog`<sup>`*`</sup>`n)`
`O(n)`
`O(logn)`
`O(loglogn)`
`O(log`<sup>`*`</sup>`n)`
`O(alpha(n))`
`O(1)`

##How to play
Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same complexity touch, they merge into a faster complexity!

Can you achieve O(1) ?

###Enjoy !
